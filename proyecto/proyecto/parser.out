Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> expression
Rule 1     expression -> IMPORT NUMPY AS ID
Rule 2     expression -> IMPORT ID FROM ID

Terminals, with rules where they appear

AS                   : 1
FROM                 : 2
ID                   : 1 2 2
IMPORT               : 1 2
NUMPY                : 1
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

expression           : 0

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . expression
    (1) expression -> . IMPORT NUMPY AS ID
    (2) expression -> . IMPORT ID FROM ID

    IMPORT          shift and go to state 2

    expression                     shift and go to state 1

state 1

    (0) S' -> expression .



state 2

    (1) expression -> IMPORT . NUMPY AS ID
    (2) expression -> IMPORT . ID FROM ID

    NUMPY           shift and go to state 3
    ID              shift and go to state 4


state 3

    (1) expression -> IMPORT NUMPY . AS ID

    AS              shift and go to state 5


state 4

    (2) expression -> IMPORT ID . FROM ID

    FROM            shift and go to state 6


state 5

    (1) expression -> IMPORT NUMPY AS . ID

    ID              shift and go to state 7


state 6

    (2) expression -> IMPORT ID FROM . ID

    ID              shift and go to state 8


state 7

    (1) expression -> IMPORT NUMPY AS ID .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (expression -> IMPORT NUMPY AS ID .)


state 8

    (2) expression -> IMPORT ID FROM ID .

    $end            reduce using rule 2 (expression -> IMPORT ID FROM ID .)
